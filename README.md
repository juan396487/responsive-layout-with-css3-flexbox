# Responsive Layout with CSS3 Flexbox
This repository includes a single html file that demonstrates how CSS3's flexbox can be implemented to quickly design responsive web pages. Flexbox is not a library or dependency, it is part of CSS3. Bootstrap, a very popular library used to develop responsive pages, uses flexbox at its core.

By developing a responsive layout without an external library(like Bootstrap) speed can be improved as the site does not need to load the library to function.

In order to focus on how flexbox is implemented, the only styling that was applied was the one required to create the layout.
